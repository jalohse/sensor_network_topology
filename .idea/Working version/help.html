<h1>Sensor network generator</h1>
<h2>User manual</h2>
This tool allows you to visualize sensor network coverage where locations of sensors are unknown.

<h3>Source code and bug reporting.</h3>
Source code available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jalohse/sensor_network_topology" target="_blank">https://github.com/jalohse/sensor_network_topology</a><br>
Documentation is available <a href="out/index.html" target="_blank">here.</a><br>
Please report any bugs you discover <a href="bug-reporting.html" target="_blank">here.</a>

<h3>Loading data</h3>
Users have the ability to load existing data sets in CSV or JSON formats. The first button in the Control Panel allows a
user to upload a CSV containing sensor locations with the column headers: LocationID, xf, yf. LocationID is a string
containing the label of the node while xf and yf refer to the actual node locations.
<br>
A JSON file can be used by clicking on the "Open" button. By using this file format, the coverage radius, radius of
uncertainty, and number of potential locations and their locations can be set.

<h3>Saving data</h3>
The current layout of sensors in the graphing area can be saved into the correct JSON format by clicking the "Save"
button. A file named data.json will automatically be downloaded. This same file can be opened with the "Open" button.

<h3>Random data generation</h3>
Users have the ability to generate random sensor locations by clicking on the "Random Data" button. By changing the
number in the user-editable text box below the button, users can control how many sensors appear based on their
preferences. Note that selecting a number of nodes greater than approximately ~150 will slow down all computations.

<h3>Data Editing</h3>

<p>
    <b>Moving nodes.</b>
    Moving an existing node can be accomplished by simply clicking on a node and then dragging the node
    to the desired location. The location and coverage circles will move along with the mouse.
    After the node is dropped into the new location the complex will be recalculated and rendered.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Deleting nodes.</b>
    Users can also select a node by clicking on it. Pressing the "delete" key on their keyboard
    will delete the node. To cancel or exit press the "esc" key.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Adding nodes.</b>
    To add a node, a user must click on the "Add node" button in the control panel. Their cursor will change to a
    crosshairs and upon clicking on a location in the graphing area a node will appear and the complex updated. Pressing
    the "esc" key will exit out of this mode.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Updating potential locations.</b>
    Each sensor also has a certain number of potential locations. By pressing the "Update" button, the potential
    locations for each sensor are given new random coordinates within the radius of uncertainty. The number of potential
    locations can be updated in the same way as the number of sensors, by updating the number in the text box and
    clicking the "Update" button.
</p>

<h3>Changing Radii.</h3>

<p>
    <b>Updating coverage radius.</b>
    Tied to sensor locations is the coverage radius of each sensor. This can be updated by
    either adjusting the slider under the "Coverage radius" heading or updating the value in the
    text box below it. The maximum value for the coverage radius is initialized as the the larger
    value between the specified value given in the load configuration and half of the largest range
    between sensors on the x-axis. This maximum value can also be changed by clicking on the
    "Max" button and typing in the desired maximum radius.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Updating radius of uncertainty.</b>
    The radius of uncertainty is the radius from the anchor location that potential locations
    can exist in. This radius can be changed just as the coverage radius changes: either by moving
    the slider or updating the value in the text box. The maximum radius of uncertainty is set to
    fifty. The radius of uncertainty is initially set to ten. If the radius is increased, the potential
    locations will not update, unless the "Update" button is pressed. Decreasing the radius of
    uncertainty below ten will recalculate potential locations.
</p>

<h3>View options</h3>
There are several options for visualizing network coverage. To add or remove each layer from the canvas simply toggle
the corresponding checkbox.

<p>
    <b>Nodes</b> correspond to sensor locations. Hovering over a node will highlight the coverage radius for that
    individual sensor.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Potential nodes</b> correspond to the randomly placed potential locations for each node.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Node coverage </b> corresponds to the transparent purple circles. The smaller of these circles designates the
    node coverage radius, while the larger represents the coverage radius plus the radius of uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Edges</b> correspond to the lines connecting each node, colored by their probability. An edge only exists if the
    coverage radii overlap for two nodes. Hovering over an edge will highlight the edge and its corresponding nodes. A
    small information box will appear near the cursor displaying the probability of that edge.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Possible edges</b> correspond to the edges that exist between potential locations within the coverage radii.
    Potential edges are shown as black lines.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Faces</b> correspond to filled triangles indicating where three points are mutually connected, colored by their
    probability. Hovering over a face will highlight the face along with the corresponding three points and edges that
    form the triangle. A small information box will appear near the cursor displaying the probability of that face. </p>

<p>The presence of a face depends on which complex type you select: </p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <b>&#268;ech</b> pertains to a simplicial complex constructed such that where the coverage for each of the three
    nodes overlaps. "Good" coverage can be guaranteed here and represents the geometric area as a face or 2-simplex in
    topological space.
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_cohomology">Reference</a>)
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Vietoris-Rips</b> is another, less computationally expensive way of calculating coverage. In this simplicial
    complex, faces
    are generated when 3 points are all pairwise within range of each other with no requirement that all three nodes
    simultaneously overlap.
    The advantage of this over the &#268;ech complex is that it is computationally less expensive. The
    disadvantage lies in the fact that there is the possibility of small coverage gaps within each face where the
    coverage radii do not all intersect the circumcenter of the resulting triangle
    in geometric space. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex">Reference</a>)

<h3>Color maps</h3>
Below the graphing area is the legend that shows the color maps for face and edge probability. There are
five choices for the face color map: yellow to blue, yellow to red, blue to purple, red, and
green. A different color map can be chosen by simply selecting the desired map in the dropdown menu. The range of
probability is split between seven different classes. The edge color map changes based on the selection for maximum
contrast. The edge color map is split between five classes across the probability range.

<h3>Zooming and panning.</h3>
A user must furst hit the "Z" key on their keyboard. This will change their cursor to a four-way directional
arrow. By scrolling the wheel of the mouse the graphing area can zoom in and out. This mode also allows users to
drag the graphing area around by simply clicking and dragging. To exit this mode, press the "Z" key on the keyboard
again.
